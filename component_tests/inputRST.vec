; Test sequence for D flip-flop with reset
; Each line is held for one 1000ps clock cycle
10  ; Cycle 1: Reset is active (RST=1, S=0)
01  ; Cycle 2: Normal operation, load 1 (RST=0, S=1)
00  ; Cycle 3: Normal operation, load 0 (RST=0, S=0)
01  ; Cycle 4: Normal operation, load 1 again
10  ; Cycle 5: Reset is active again
